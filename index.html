                <p class="info1">This project was made using Visual Studio Code. I used basic Html and CSS when creating the webpage. It is a simple webpage loosely based off of Imdb. This was my first independent project when learning how to use HTML and CSS.</p>

                <img src="./assets/images/project2.jpeg" alt="Project2 SS">
                <p class="info2">I used Replit when making this project. I used Html, CSS, and JavaScript to create my to do list. Using these elements I made an input bar to enter your task and with the added JavaScript element it will put the items into a list in which you are able to mark the tasks that were entered as completed. This was my first project where I used JavaScript with Html and CSS.</p>

                <p class="info3">I used replit for this project as well. I used Html, CSS, and JavaScript to create a basic page when learning about creating buttons and using them to toggle the screen. The button on the page changes the color scheme to make it into night mode as well as having the ability to change it back to day mode. This project, although fairly simple, gave me a lot more practice and understanding of how CSS and JavaScript work together on a webpage. </p>
